## What is programming?

This section will be fixed in [issue #32](https://github.com/clojurebridge-minneapolis/installfest/issues/32)

We should include the YOU ARE HERE infographic from [issue #25](https://github.com/clojurebridge-minneapolis/installfest/issues/25)

*Use the meal planning analogy: an algorithm is a like a recipe.*


*Think of a way to demonstrate the idea of imperative programming (mutations) in the analogy*


## What is "functional programming"?

Functional programming means programs are comprised of many, small functions:
each of which take some input and provide some output
* don't need to think about changes outside the function
* functions are small
* take shapes in, return shapes out (*geometry -- vector/map example*)

*Use with the analogy*


## Why Clojure??

LISP is a classic functional programming language which dates back to 1954.
*explain homiconicity*

LISP has generally been used in academia (note **ITA** as an exception),
has evolved relatively slowly and has a modest set of available libraries.


In designing Clojure Rich Hickey combined the good parts of LISP (functional
programming) and combined it with the powerful and popular Java Virtual Machine.
As a result Clojure is an *opinionated* LISP that...
* Is simpler to learn and understand (much easier than Java)
* Has higher performance and better platform support thanks to the Java Virtual Machine
  (note also: JavaScript, CLR)
* Provides easy interoperation with many existing Java libraries
* Can be used for both client and server development (ClojureScript has one of the
  best stories for web development)

And it turns out the Clojure community is wonderful
* Tends to be full of explorers: people that are curious, eager to learn and happy to help each other
* Typically big companies are hesitant to adopt new technologies and Clojure
  is growing in progressively more commercial use.
* Values diversity (conference opportunity grants, ClojureBridge)

## Open Source: why the Community is important

What is open source software?
* *volunteer*
* *gratis, hack on copyright -- so we can share!*
* *built on the shoulders of giants*
* *examples*
* not just code, community: user groups, online, conferences
* contribution: using, filing bugs, fixing documentation, editing code
* Why OSS is better
  *  investment in learning
  * integrate - make it work for me, scratch an itch
  * people are dialed into their passion
  * privacy and security
* Why diversity in tech (esp. OSS) is important
  * Women are 50% of users, but only 15% contributors
  * For any software to be successful it *has* to take the needs of users into account
  * We want OSS to win: we need YOU!

Today you will publish an program on the Internet!

After today you can continue your learning...
* Join the clojure.mn user group
* Continue to converse with people you've met on Slack
* Join us at the Conj - registration is free! *note: lambda ladies, opp grants*
* Going further GSOC (e.g. Maria Gellar), Outreachy
* Code academies (e.g. Prime)
